# Ultimate Mineflayer bot
It will be soon, anyways.
## What does it do?
It has a couple of feature, such as chatting "sleep" and it sleeps, chat "come" and it comes to you, and chest interactions. Read through the code for all features.

I'd love to see any bug reports, fixes, or anything to make this bot better. Thanks you!

## Why did I do it?
I'm lonely

## How to Use

Install it and use it like any other Mineflayer bot. You'll need node.js, Visual Studio Code, a minecraft account for yourself, and some knowledge on JavaScript. You'll need to change the port to whatever your port is, and if you want to use it in a server, you'll need to make sure online-mode is false.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Mining features
- [ ] Have it check to sleep, and then sleep
- [ ] It follows you when you say "follow" and stops when you say "stop"
- [ ] PVP Features
